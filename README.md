## ‚úÖ Project Tests (User Stories)

1. You should have an input element with an id of `search-input` and it should be required.
2. You should have a button element with an id of `search-button`.
3. You should have an element with an id of `creature-name`.
4. You should have an element with an id of `creature-id`.
5. You should have an element with an id of `weight`.
6. You should have an element with an id of `height`.
7. You should have an element with an id of `types`.
8. You should have an element with an id of `hp`.
9. You should have an element with an id of `attack`.
10. You should have an element with an id of `defense`.
11. You should have an element with an id of `special-attack`.
12. You should have an element with an id of `special-defense`.
13. You should have an element with an id of `speed`.
14. When the `#search-input` contains the value `Red` and the `#search-button` is clicked, an alert should appear with the text **"Creature not found"**.
15. When the `#search-input` contains the value `Pyrolynx` and the `#search-button` is clicked, the displayed values should be:  
    - Name: PYROLYNX  
    - ID: 1 or #1  
    - Weight: 42 or Weight: 42  
    - Height: 32 or Height: 32  
    - HP: 65  
    - Attack: 80  
    - Defense: 50  
    - Special Attack: 90  
    - Special Defense: 55  
    - Speed: 100
16. When the `#search-input` contains `Pyrolynx` and the `#search-button` is clicked, a single element should be added inside `#types` containing the text **FIRE**. The content of `#types` should be cleared between searches.
17. When the `#search-input` contains `2` and the `#search-button` is clicked, the displayed values should be:  
    - Name: AQUOROC  
    - ID: 2 or #2  
    - Weight: 220 or Weight: 220  
    - Height: 53 or Height: 53
